                arrested and sent to prison for statutory rape. But when I have sexual intercourse with a fetus, it is totally acceptable by societal <br>
                standards of today. This just makes it more evident that society is so apathetic towards Men's mental health. Men only get 10% of the wages<br>
                women get, our ballsacks get lower and lower as we age, and 92% of men wipe their ass reaching between their legs rather than reaching <br>
                around their buttocks. Only 86% of us only wipe with our bare hands which is preposterous. "<br>

                fallacy, and appeal to emotion logical fallacy. It's wrong to have sex with an underage fetus, literally an embryo, it's because they're <br>
                not mentally developed yet. The studies show that the embryo becomes a fetus at 2 weeks old, and even disregarding science, it's just wrong<br>
                to have sex with an embryo, even if they're just a couple days from become a fetus. There's a reason why I don't institute Men's rights, is <br>
                because we owe it to women who've had it so much harder than us throughout history, and every second they live around men? That's <br>
