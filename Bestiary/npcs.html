            The majority that makes up this unaligned demographic are mostly <a href="garbagesouls.html">garbage souls</a> that live within Modern society. 
            While there are a few outliers who reach enough mind vril to attain awareness of their situation, 
            it is all but wasted, and they continue to live in their mundane life of regularly scheduled government programmed, whether that be by willful ignorance, 
            a lack of drive to change their situation, or be unfortunate enough to be unable to change their situation. There can be many more reasons as to why they are unguided, 
            or refuse to be guided by either themselves or a master. 
            They mindlessly go through the flow of life, or remain stagnant, as a character and in life. There is little that changes about them, and little character that grows, 
            their minds are purely at the disposal of <a href="gib.html">GIB</a> psychic influence, and the amount of minds that are under it's control are in the billions.
